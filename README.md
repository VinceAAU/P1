# P1
This is our P1 project. It is currently empty, but that is not something that you need to worry about. Worrying is our job.

This repository is not public yet, so you probably don't have any questions. If, by any chance, GitHub has a security breach that allows people to see this repository, and one of those people are interested, we can be contacted at cs-22-sw-1-p1-02@student.aau.dk, or at our individual emails:
